Basic Battle System Test

### First Commit

Added the basic classes for the actors, battle and the main.cpp. Only battle option 
with basic logic is ATTACK. The combatant takes a point value from the target based on
the combatants HP value. Will be updated at a later date, just wanted to verify logic
was working. HEAL also included but has no logic currently.

No validation for target selection so can still error out. Will add at later date.

Still to add turn order adjustment, currently only moves in order as the actors were 
added to vector.
